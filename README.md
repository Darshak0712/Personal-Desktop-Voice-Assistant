## More Details :


- On first start up , we get wishese from assistant as per timings like good morning,evening,etc. Basically , after starting waiting for our command and if suppose any reason
  we coudn't say command then don't worry again and again he will ask for query because i have used recursion in command function so if exception occurs the again recall itself 
	for getting our commands.

-  **Smart Query Processing** : I have tried to provide keywords smartly like instead of providing long keywords i have break them in small parts and connected(using and/or) them as per required so even there
   will be any other words in between keywords then also we will not face any problem. for example ,in 'open whatsapp' keyword suppose someone say like 'open my whatsapp' then 
	 it will not work so i have break them like 'open' and 'whatsapp' so both words are required but no problem with words in between them. 

- I have widely used recursion in many places one of them is main function , main function also call itself again and again after our query process so inshort it will not stop 
  untill we desire. But now you will think that if that happen so he will here everythings whatever we said and try to process everything that we don't want. To prevent this i 
	have created sleep mode function.
	
-  Once sleep mode is activated , it's like running process in background and at that time no other commands will process except from wake up or close commands. i will provide source for 
   non-technical people to understand process keywords to start any process by voice assistant.Already examples are given but i'll provide full list of keywords that you may use
	 to perform different taks.

- I know many of you will think that in sleep mode also continuously command input is taking but **difference between sleep and normal** command taking mode is that during sleep mode 
  just taking commands only not processing them for further taks like we are doing in normally.just we can wake up assistant for any other tasks or we can also get exit from here directly
	during sleep mode.Here exit means totally program will stop it's execution and we have to again run manually once to perform new tasks again.

-  i hope now you don't have confusion regarding sleep mode and exit. inshort sleep mode is just like pausing assistant for some time and then we can again activate using speech commands
   but once we have perform exit(**keywords for exit** _`'bye'`_ , _`'stop this'`_,_`'close this'`_,etc. ) then program will stop execution and then we can't use it with directly voice
	 commands untill we run it again.

-  if you have still confusion then you can contact me.

 Future Developement Planning :
 ---

-  I will be working on this project to add some extra new features. Also i have some ideas regarding some code modifications and new features to integrate with this like whatsapp automation ,
   sleep mode modifications(auto sleep while continuously command failure), and many more surprises are coming soon.
	 
-  Most welcome for ideas and suggestions from your side because the more we will be together, more better results we can get together. **sharing is caring**ðŸ˜Š
